# Code Projects From My CS1 Class
This repository is all projects from my CS1 class. CodeHS was used as our IDE. 

Unfortunately, I did not save a lot of my work, so there is not a lot to show off (and the assignment instructions are gone).

We used only Python, and all of the projects are pretty basic since it was a first year CS class.
